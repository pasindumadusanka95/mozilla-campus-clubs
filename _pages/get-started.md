  <p>Everything you need to know about registering an existing Campus Clubs.</p>

  <p>For registering your Club, it should meet the following:
    <li><b>Established</b>: For the meantime we want to focus on learning how we can support the groups who are already around. We love that you want to start a new group but we’ll ask that you get started first, then register with Mozilla.</li>
    <li><b>Hold Regular Meetings:</b> They can be in-person or virtual, but we want to support groups that have a regular cadence of getting together to coordinate, plan, and work.</li>
    <li><b>Contribute to Mozilla:</b> Obviously! You need to make regular contributions to projects that support Mozilla’s mission, whether it be localizing, coding, answering support questions, throwing events, or participating in campaigns.</li>
    <li><b>Have at Least 3 Members:</b> Hanging out with a few friends is great but in order to be registered Campus Clubs must have an active set of contributors 3+ members.</li>
    <li><b>Are Open and Welcoming:</b> Mozilla and it’s official groups welcome everyone who shares Mozilla’s goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner to participate. Groups cannot restrict membership.</li>
    <li><b>Follow the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/">CPG</a>;</b> The heart of Mozilla is people as such we require all groups who participated to agree to adhere and uphold to the Community Participation Guidelines (CPG).</li>
